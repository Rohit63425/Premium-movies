                        Radhika essayed by Alaya F, who is a dedicated intern
                        working
                        for a local newspaper. In the film she investigates multiple accidents that occur at a
                        particular
                        flyover. After concluding that motorists taking a U-turn are the root cause for this, she starts
                        dealing
                        with motorists personally and addresses this issue. However, her investigation takes a dark turn
                        when
                        one of the U-turn riders is found dead and she becomes the prime suspect.

                        Sub-inspector Arjun Sinha played by Priyanshu Painyuli is involved to uncover the case. During
                        the
                        course of investigation, the police uncover a more sinister connection. All those who have taken
                        the
                        U-turn have ended up dead, and there is strong evidence linking Radhika to these deaths.
                        However,
                        multiple supernatural occurrences entangle them into a dark web of secrets.</h5>
